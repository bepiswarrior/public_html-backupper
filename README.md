# public_html-backupper
A crude backup script to make .tar file of Apache2's public_html directory and copy it to your local machine. For Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie).

I hope no one ever bothers to even check this out since this is merely a test how to use github and webhook on Discord.

Yes, it really is only a simple bash script. Nor do I think it's nothing more than that. But at least the name is pretty cool, huh?
